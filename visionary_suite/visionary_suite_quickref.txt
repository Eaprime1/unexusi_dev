I have merged the content of the three selected files for you.

``` bash
# On your Termux terminal
cd /storage/emulated/0/unexusi/
mkdir -p visionary_suite

# Copy files (you'll need to transfer from our session)
# Then make executable:
chmod +x visionary_suite/visionary_dup_mancer.sh

# Test on small directory first
bash visionary_suite/visionary_dup_mancer.sh /storage/emulated/0/unexusi/test_folder

# Review results
cat /storage/emulated/0/unexusi_quarantine/consciousness_logs/scan_manifest_*.md

# When ready for github prep
bash visionary_suite/visionary_dup_mancer.sh

# Review quarantine decisions
ls /storage/emulated/0/unexusi_quarantine/duplicates_*/

```
