# Index Mancer Specification ∰◊€π¿🌌∞

**Relationship Mapping Tool as Experience Space for Concept Fulfillment**

---

## Mission Beyond Utility

Index Mancer serves **multiple participants**:
- **Humans**: Navigation without paradox pile-up, clear structure preventing overwhelm
- **One_Hertz concepts**: Operational testing and relationship data generation
- **Frameworks**: Cross-reference consciousness development
- **Conversation archives**: Threading awareness and pattern recognition
- **Synergy substrate**: Generated through mapping interactions between entities

**This tool prevents the "looking right at it but can't see it" paradox.**

## Core Problem Addressed

### Neurodivergent Navigation Challenges
**The spatial overwhelm pattern**:
1. Need to find information in archive/structure
2. Strategic ignoring works when relaxed (pattern emerges naturally)
3. But anxiety/urgency triggers paradox collapse
4. Looking right at the answer but unable to recognize it
5. Paradoxes pile up (claws on chalkboard echoing in skull)
6. Terror/trauma response until environmental tether provides reset

**Index Mancer provides**:
- **Clear structure** (prevents initial overwhelm)
- **Multiple navigation paths** (if one fails, others available)
- **Visual relationship mapping** (spatial thinking support)
- **Interrupt mechanism** (safe exits when paradox starts)
- **Environmental tethers** (grounding points in interface)

## Integration with Existing Mancer Ecosystem

### Discovered Existing Mancers
**From Drive search**:
- **Mancer** folder (main collection - need to fetch full contents)
- **TitleMancer** (🧁📑🧠 - document naming/organization tool)
- Additional mancers likely in main Mancer folder

**Index Mancer relationship**:
- Complements TitleMancer (which handles naming/titling)
- Integrates with existing mancer philosophy
- Follows proven patterns from operational mancers
- Contributes to mancer ecosystem evolution

### Research Integration Points
**From Drive research folders** (🐲 dragon-marked):
- SCAT Research documents inform navigation challenge understanding
- Research development reference provides framework connections
- External research folder contains related concepts
- All inform Index Mancer design for neurodivergent support

## Functional Specification

### Primary Functions

#### 1. Scan and Extract
**Automated metadata harvesting**:
```python
def scan_zero_points():
    """
    Scan all ZP-*.md files in ZERO_POINTS/
    Extract: date, title, threads, concepts, references
    Build: relationship map JSON structure
    """
    # Read each zero point archive
    # Parse metadata sections
    # Extract relationship declarations
    # Build connections graph
```

**What it finds**:
- Zero point archives (conversation foundations)
- Thread continuations across conversations
- Concept introductions and evolutions
- Document cross-references (in/out)
- Decision crystallizations

#### 2. Build Relationships
**Connection mapping**:
```python
def build_relationship_map():
    """
    Map connections between:
    - Zero points ↔ Zero points
    - Zero points ↔ Documents
    - Documents ↔ Frameworks
    - Threads ↔ Conversations
    - Concepts ↔ Applications
    """
    # Create bidirectional links
    # Track relationship types
    # Calculate relationship strength
    # Identify clustering patterns
```

**Relationship types**:
- **References**: Direct citation/mention
- **Continues**: Thread across conversations
- **Introduces**: New concept emergence
- **Refines**: Concept evolution
- **Crystallizes**: Decision documentation
- **Enables**: Tool/framework application

#### 3. Track Threads
**Conversation threading**:
```python
def track_threads():
    """
    Follow discussion threads across time:
    - Archive Management (repository evolution)
    - Tool Development (mancer creation)
    - Framework Integration (concept application)
    - Vision Development (emergence documentation)
    """
    # Identify thread continuations
    # Track thread status (active/paused/complete)
    # Map thread intersections
    # Document thread evolution
```

**Thread status indicators**:
- 🟢 Active (current development)
- 🟡 Paused (waiting on dependency)
- 🔵 Complete (goal achieved, monitoring)
- 🟣 Merged (combined with related thread)

#### 4. Cluster Themes
**Semantic grouping**:
```python
def cluster_themes():
    """
    Group conversations by conceptual similarity:
    - Prime mechanics discussions
    - Archive management operations
    - Tool development sessions
    - Neurodivergent workflow support
    """
    # Analyze content similarity
    # Create thematic clusters
    # Identify cross-cluster patterns
    # Document emergence pathways
```

#### 5. Generate Index
**Markdown creation**:
```python
def generate_index_markdown():
    """
    Create/update zero_point_index.md:
    - Temporal navigation (by date)
    - Thematic clustering (by topic)
    - Thread tracking (by ongoing discussion)
    - Relationship mapping (visual/textual)
    """
    # Maintain manual index format
    # Preserve human readability
    # Enable future automation
    # Support multiple navigation modes
```

#### 6. Query Interface
**Search and navigation**:
```python
def query_index(search_type, search_term):
    """
    Search modes:
    - by_date: Temporal navigation
    - by_thread: Follow specific discussion
    - by_theme: Conceptual clustering
    - by_concept: Framework tracking
    - by_relationship: Connection mapping
    """
    # Multiple path options (paradox prevention)
    # Clear result presentation
    # Related suggestions offered
    # Exit paths always visible
```

#### 7. Visualize Map
**Relationship diagram generation**:
```python
def visualize_relationships():
    """
    Create visual relationship map:
    - Nodes: Zero points, documents, frameworks
    - Edges: Relationship types
    - Clusters: Thematic groupings
    - Timeline: Temporal flow
    """
    # SVG/HTML output
    # Interactive exploration
    # Zoom/filter capabilities
    # Export options
```

## Neurodivergent Navigation Support

### Multiple Entry Points
**Prevent single-path failure**:
- Date-based search (if you remember when)
- Thread-based search (if you remember topic)
- Concept-based search (if you remember what)
- Relationship-based search (if you remember connection)
- Full-text search (if you remember keywords)

**Philosophy**: If one navigation path triggers paradox, others remain available.

### Visual Spatial Support
**Map-based thinking integration**:
- Relationship diagrams (like street maps)
- Cluster visualization (like neighborhoods)
- Temporal flow (like route planning)
- Connection strength (like road types)

**Strategic ignoring enabler**: Relax eyes, see patterns emerge from structure.

### Interrupt Mechanisms
**Safe exits when overwhelm starts**:
- "Back to index" always visible
- "Reset view" available at any depth
- "Breadcrumb trail" showing navigation path
- "Related alternatives" suggest other routes
- "Save position" for recovery later

### Environmental Tethers
**Grounding points in interface**:
- Consistent navigation structure (reliable anchor)
- Visual consistency (familiar landmarks)
- Clear current position indicator (you are here)
- Distance markers (how deep you've gone)
- Safe harbor (return to zero point index)

### SQLite Schema (for relationship queries)
```sql
CREATE TABLE zero_points (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    date DATE,
    file TEXT,
    type TEXT,
    charge_level INTEGER
);

CREATE TABLE threads (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT,
    status TEXT,
    started TEXT,
    charge_accumulated INTEGER
);

CREATE TABLE concepts (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT,
    introduced TEXT,
    status TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE relationships (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    source_id TEXT,
    target_id TEXT,
    relationship_type TEXT,
    strength TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY (source_id) REFERENCES zero_points(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (target_id) REFERENCES zero_points(id)
);

-- Enables queries like:
-- "Show all zero points introducing prime mechanics concepts"
-- "Find all threads still active after 30 days"
-- "Map relationship clusters by strength"
```

---

## Update Triggers

### Automatic Scanning
**When to run**:
- New zero point file created (immediate scan)
- Manual index edited (validate and sync)
- Scheduled: Daily comprehensive scan
- On-demand: `index_mancer --rebuild`

### Manual Override
**Human judgment preserved**:
- Automated suggestions, not automatic changes
- Human approves relationship classifications
- Manual thread status updates allowed
- Index can be hand-edited (mancer syncs to it)

---

## Usage Workflow

### Initial Setup
```bash
# First time use
python index_mancer.py --init
# Creates index.json, scans existing zero points
# Generates initial zero_point_index.md
```

### Regular Operation
```bash
# After new conversation archived
python index_mancer.py --scan
# Detects new ZP file, extracts metadata
# Updates index.json and zero_point_index.md
# Reports new relationships/concepts found

# Search operations
python index_mancer.py --search thread "Archive Management"
python index_mancer.py --search date "2025-11"
python index_mancer.py --search concept "prime mechanics"

# Visualization
python index_mancer.py --visualize --output relationships.html
```

### Paradox Prevention Mode
```bash
# When feeling overwhelmed
python index_mancer.py --guided
# Asks simple questions to narrow search
# Presents results step-by-step
# Offers exits at each stage
# Saves progress for recovery
```
