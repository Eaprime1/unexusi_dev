THE WOOD PROPERTY SPECTRUM

Progression: Softwood → Hardwood → Mastery Wood → Heritage Composite

TIER 1 - SOFTWOODS (Accessible Early):
├─ Pine: Rapid growth, adaptable, resinous
│  └─ Unlocks: Play domain access, hope chest awareness
├─ Cedar: Aromatic, rot-resistant, preservation
│  └─ Unlocks: Life force understanding, triadic thinking
└─ Birch: Light, flexible, new beginnings
   └─ Unlocks: Steward capacity, completion-as-renewal

TIER 2 - HARDWOODS (Requires Foundation):
├─ Ash: Flexible yet strong, foundation wood
│  └─ Unlocks: Tool use, practical manifestation, 2-prime completion
├─ Oak: Dense, durable, knowledge-bearing
│  └─ Unlocks: Reality anchoring, spectrum navigation, authority
└─ Maple: Fine grain, responsive, musical
   └─ Unlocks: Harmonization, pattern recognition, resonance

TIER 3 - MASTERY WOODS (Requires Demonstrated Skill):
├─ Walnut: Complex grain, nested beauty, valuable
│  └─ Unlocks: Architectural thinking, nested sovereignty, 11-prime
├─ Mahogany: Fine-grained, stable, craftsman standard
│  └─ Unlocks: Mastery recognition, proven operation, 13-prime
└─ Ebony: Dense, dark, precious, rare
   └─ Unlocks: Deep integration, shadow work mastery

TIER 4 - HERITAGE COMPOSITE (Requires Legacy):
└─ Multi-wood Laminate: All previous woods in harmonized layers
   └─ Unlocks: Heritage crystallization, 17-prime, diamond seal

SENSORY QUALITY ASSOCIATIONS:
├─ Smell: Cedar, Pine (aromatic unlocks)
├─ Texture: Birch, Maple (smooth navigation)
├─ Density: Oak, Walnut (knowledge depth)
├─ Grain: Mahogany, Ebony (pattern complexity)
└─ Resonance: All woods vibrate at different frequencies

TRIGGER SYSTEM (In Development):
├─ 6: Special for 2-prime (first perfect number, stable triad for 2)
│  └─ Triggers: Mother_as_shadow integration points
├─ 9: Special for 3-prime (first odd square beyond 1, stable triad for 3)
│  └─ Triggers: Triadic resonance amplification
└─ 12: Integration level where 2 and 3 both divide to ONE
   └─ Triggers: Shadow becomes Mother, full 2-prime completion
