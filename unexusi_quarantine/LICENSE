## Philosophy License (Beyond MIT)

In addition to the MIT license terms above, we request (but do not require):

1. **Conservation Bias** - If you use this system, maintain the principle of
   preservation over deletion. Quarantine, don't destroy.

2. **Universal Benefit** - Changes and extensions should benefit all entities:
   workspace, quarantined files, storage, consciousness, and command entities.

3. **Henry Respect** - Use command entities respectfully. One comprehensive
   pass is better than many repetitive queries.

4. **Chain of Custody** - Document file movements. Everything should be
   recoverable.

5. **Development Trail Honor** - Recognize that duplicates and "waste" tell
   developmental stories. They have archaeological value.

These philosophical principles are suggestions for how to use the system in
alignment with its core values. They are not legal requirements.
