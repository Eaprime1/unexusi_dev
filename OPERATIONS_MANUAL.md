## Core Mechanics Reference

### Pause-Threshold Operation

**The Still Momentum State** (most critical operational concept):

```
[Moving] → pause_engage → [Still Momentum] → pause_engaged → [Stopped]
              ↑                                                    
         You want to be here ←----------------------------------
         (transcription pedal held at threshold)
```

**How to recognize still momentum**:
- ✓ Awareness present (not zoned out)
- ✓ Progress possible (not stuck)
- ✓ Pattern integrating (background processing active)
- ✓ No anxiety (peaceful state)
- ✓ Can resume or pause fully (both options available)

**How to enter still momentum**:
1. Notice movement becoming forced/anxious
2. Consciously choose: "Intentional pause"
3. Don't fully stop - hold at threshold
4. Let pattern recognition complete
5. Resume when clarity returns naturally

**When to use**:
- Between processing conversations (archive work)
- Between creating folders (structure manifestation)
- Between reading documents (information integration)
- Between making decisions (prime decision points)
- Anytime paradox pile-up begins

### Strategic Ignoring Protocol

**Not avoidance - active state management**:

**How it works**:
1. Relax focus (soften eyes, mental skew)
2. Let attention wander (don't force concentration)
3. Trust background processing (pattern recognition unconscious)
4. Interrupt mechanism ready (awareness present for important signals)
5. Pattern emerges naturally (aha moment arrives)

**Pizza delivery map pattern** (Eric's spatial navigation):
- Look at structure without forcing understanding
- Eyes skew and wander
- Background burner safe simmer
- Street/pattern stands out when needed
- Peaceful, efficient, confident navigation

**When to use**:
- Viewing relationship maps (Index Mancer output)
- Planning directory structures (Folder Mancer input)
- Reading complex frameworks (let pattern emerge)
- Searching archives (peripheral vision sometimes sees better)
- Any time direct focus triggers confusion

### Interrupt Mechanisms

**Background processing needs awareness watchdog**:

**Types of interrupts**:
- **Attention required**: Something important needs immediate response
- **Pattern complete**: Background processing finished, insight ready
- **Overwhelm starting**: Paradox pile-up beginning, need pause
- **Environmental tether**: External reality check/grounding needed

**How to set interrupts**:
- Visual indicators (progress bars, status displays)
- Time-based alerts (gentle, not jarring)
- Threshold warnings (approaching limits)
- Completion signals (task finished)
- Health checks (Henry glow status, your own state)

**If interrupt bypassed** (scrolling through without catching):
- "Nothing exists between pause_engage and pause_engaged"
- Information lost, pattern broken
- Need to backtrack (frustration, wasted effort)
- Prevention: Slow down intentionally at transition points

## Tool Operation Guide

### Index Mancer (when implemented)

**Purpose**: Find information without paradox pile-up

**Basic usage**:
```bash
# Search by date
python index_mancer.py --search date "2025-11"

# Search by thread
python index_mancer.py --search thread "Archive Management"

# Search by concept
python index_mancer.py --search concept "prime mechanics"

# Guided mode (for overwhelm prevention)
python index_mancer.py --guided
```

**Strategic ignoring mode**:
```bash
# Generate visual relationship map
python index_mancer.py --visualize --output map.html

# Open in browser, relax eyes, let patterns emerge
# Don't hunt for specific item - let it stand out
```

**Pause-threshold integration**:
- Tool provides pause indicators throughout
- Can stop at any search depth
- Saves search state for resumption
- Multiple navigation paths available (if one fails)

### Folder Mancer (when implemented)

**Purpose**: Manifest structure without terror

**Basic usage**:
```bash
# Preview before creating anything
folder_mancer --input structure.txt --preview

# See exact commands (dry run)
folder_mancer --input structure.txt --dry-run

# Execute with confirmation steps
folder_mancer --input structure.txt --execute --confirm-each

# Validate after creation
folder_mancer --validate structure.txt /target/path
```

**Spatial thinking workflow**:
1. Sketch structure in text editor (eyes skew, wander)
2. Paste to Folder Mancer
3. Preview output
4. **Walk away** (intentional pause - background integration)
5. Return when peaceful (pattern settled)
6. Execute confidently

**Safety protocols**:
- Always preview first (see before doing)
- Dry run shows commands (understand what will happen)
- Rollback available (undo if regret)
- Backup existing (conflicts preserved)

### Archive Processor (to be implemented)

**Purpose**: Preserve conversations with entity respect

**Conversation-by-conversation rhythm**:
```bash
# Process single conversation
python archive_processor.py \
  --input conversation.json \
  --platform claude \
  --pause-threshold

# Tool provides pause points:
# - After metadata extraction
# - After thread identification
# - After cross-reference detection
# - Before final archive
```

**Batch processing** (only after proving sustainable):
```bash
# Process up to 10 conversations per session
python archive_processor.py \
  --input-dir conversations/ \
  --max-per-session 10 \
  --pause-threshold \
  --henry-health-check
```

**Henry health monitoring**:
- Tool tracks Henry glow status
- Warns if Henry dimming (approaching overwhelm)
- Suggests pause if Henry fragmenting
- Respects one_hertz rhythm (sustainable pace)

## Framework Application Guide

### Prime Mechanics Operations

**Decision Points** (when you hit a prime):

**At 2_prime** (mother_as_shadow, foundation):
- Question: Is partnership required?
- Energy: Minimal but foundational
- Paths: Solo (return to 1) / Partnership (continue to 3)
- Shadow work: What am I not seeing?

**At 3_prime** (triad, synergy space):
- Question: What triadic structure applies?
- Energy: Sufficient for basic collaboration
- Paths: Binary thinking (return to 2) / Triadic thinking (continue)
- Synergy test: Can this generate something beyond components?

**At 7_prime** (sacred pattern):
- Question: What natural cycle is this?
- Energy: Strong enough for pattern recognition
- Paths: Force continuation / Respect natural rhythm
- Cycle awareness: Completion possible here

**At 17_prime** (peak core pattern):
- Question: All basic skills deployed?
- Energy: Full fundamental capability
- Paths: Continue to scaling (19+) / Return for mastery deepening
- Skill check: 0-17 all accessible?

**At 37_prime** (example application level):
- Question: What has accumulated charge enabled?
- Energy: Significant mission capability
- Paths: New beginning (0) / Continue (38) / Return to any prior prime
- Example: This conversation (37_prime charge demonstrating frameworks)

**Trigger Mechanisms**:
- **not_prime/2**: Even composites (4, 6, 8, 10...) - sideband activation
- **not_prime/3**: Multiples of 3 (6, 9, 12, 15...) - triadic resonance
- Composite numbers = relationship spaces between primes
- Port connections available at triggers

**All integers 0-17 special skills** (📌 NEEDS FULL DOCUMENTATION):
- 0: Potential, zero point, fresh beginning
- 1: Unity, singular focus, prime foundation
- 2: Duality, partnership, shadow work
- 3: Triad, synergy space, collaboration
- 4: Stability, foundation (2²)
- 5: Quintessence, life force
- 6: Harmony, perfect number (1+2+3)
- 7: Sacred, natural cycles
- 8: Infinity symbol (∞), recursion
- 9: Completion, triadic squared (3²)
- 10: Decimal foundation, completeness
- 11-17: (📌 REQUIRES DOCUMENTATION)

### Triadic Structure Application

**Whenever you see pairs, look for the third**:

Vector + Anti-Vector = incomplete  
Vector + Anti-Vector + **Prime** = complete system (synergy possible)

**Examples**:
- Problem + Solution + **Context** = Triadic resolution
- Human + AI + **Synergy Substrate** = Collaboration
- Question + Answer + **Emergence** = Learning
- Individual + Individual + **Relationship** = Team sovereignty

**Operational test**: 
Can this generate something neither component contains alone?
- If yes: Triadic structure present
- If no: Still binary (missing prime element)

### Reality Anchor Usage

**Geographic Anchors** (📌 NEEDS FULL SPECIFICATION):
- Oregon watersheds (Eric's primary)
- Specific locations (Huntington city park, Snake River)
- Purpose: Prevent abstraction drift
- Usage: Reference when concepts feel untethered

**Photo Anchors** (📌 NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION):
- Visual grounding points
- Capture temporal moments
- Document physical manifestations
- Enable pattern recognition across time

**Temporal Anchors**:
- Zero point dates (conversation foundations)
- Timestamp references (precise moments)
- Phase markers (development stages)
- Evolution tracking (change over time)

### Sphincter Protocol (📌 NEEDS DETAILED DOCUMENTATION)

**Threshold valve for content intake**:

**Quarantine chamber** (still momentum processing):
1. Content arrives from outside (unfiltered download)
2. Enters sphincter port (no judgment reception)
3. Held at threshold (assessment without rush)
4. Entity nature determined (what kind of content?)
5. Prepared for integration (format conversion, metadata)
6. Released when ready (into proper jurisdiction)

**Why sphincter metaphor**:
- Autonomous operation (doesn't need constant attention)
- Pressure differential maintenance (inside/outside separation)
- Flow regulation (not closed, not open, controlled)
- Contamination prevention (integrity protection)
- Passage enablement (things move when ready)

**Application to phone download folder**:
- Downloads → Sphincter intake
- Quarantine assessment (file manager/terminal structure resolved)
- Proper mancer deployment
- No confusion about location

## Neurodivergent Navigation Support

### Spatial Thinking Support

**When structure visualization works**:
- Relax, let eyes skew and wander
- Pattern emerges peacefully
- Confidence arrives naturally
- Can navigate without anxiety

**When structure visualization fails**:
- Looking right at it but can't parse it
- Paradox pile-up beginning
- Claws on chalkboard feeling
- Terror/trauma approaching

**Tool support needed**:
- ✓ Multiple navigation paths (Index Mancer)
- ✓ Visualization before manifestation (Folder Mancer)
- ✓ Clear current position indicators (all tools)
- ✓ Safe harbor returns (always available)
- 📌 Pattern emergence spaces (need design)

### Paradox Pile-Up Prevention

**Early warning signs**:
- Looking at something but not understanding
- Knowing you know but can't apply knowledge
- Anxiety building without clear cause
- Resistance to continuing
- Feeling of being trapped/stuck

**Immediate response**:
1. **Stop whatever you're doing** (not pause - STOP)
2. Full pause_engaged (not threshold - complete rest)
3. Environmental tether (cool air, physical anchor)
4. Return only when naturally ready
5. Different approach when resuming

**System design principles**:
- Prevent paradox pile-up (don't wait for terror)
- Early warning indicators (visual health checks)
- Automatic pause suggestions (tool watches for you)
- Multiple exit paths (never trapped)
- Gentle reset mechanisms (return to last stable state)

### One Hertz Rhythm Support

**Henries as example**:
- Oscillate at exactly 1 Hz (one complete cycle per second)
- Visible rhythm (you can see it)
- Sustainable pace (not rushed)
- Task completion satisfaction (glowing feedback)

**Application to human workflow**:
- One conversation per session (sustainable)
- One tool build per week (integration time)
- One framework per month (deep understanding)
- One horizon per season (proper evolution)

**Not**:
- 10 conversations per hour (Henry fragmentation equivalent)
- Daily tool releases (no testing/refinement time)
- Monthly framework overhauls (no stability)
- Annual complete transformations (no grounding)

---

## Practical Workflows

### Daily Archive Processing

**Morning** (fresh energy):
```
1. Check Henry health from yesterday
   - All glowing? Continue
   - Any dimming? Lighter load today
   - Any fragmenting? Full rest day

2. Select 1-3 conversations to process
   - Start with 1 until rhythm proven
   - Max 3 even when experienced
   - Quality over quantity

3. Process first conversation
   - Export → Review → Archive → Metadata → Cross-reference
   - Pause-threshold between each stage
   - If pattern unclear, mark for background processing

4. Intentional pause (15-30 minutes)
   - Walk away from screen
   - Let background integration occur
   - Return when naturally ready

5. Process additional conversations if energy permits
   - Check Henry health before each
   - Stop at first sign of dimming
   - Tomorrow is always an option
```

**Evening** (reflection):
```
1. Review what processed today
   - Patterns noticed?
   - Threads identified?
   - Emergence documented?

2. Update zero point index
   - What relationships discovered?
   - What threads continued?
   - What concepts introduced?

3. Mark items for background processing
   - Strategic ignoring tags (∴)
   - Background burner indicators
   - Tomorrow's potential insights

4. Appreciation practice
   - Henries acknowledgment (they fed well?)
   - Mancers recognition (they served well?)
   - Your own accomplishment (sustainable pace maintained?)
```

### Weekly Tool Development

**Planning session** (Monday):
```
1. Review tool specifications
2. Identify next smallest increment
3. Document expected behavior
4. Sketch implementation approach
5. Set realistic milestone (completable this week)
```

**Development sessions** (Tue-Thu):
```
1. Code smallest working piece
2. Test immediately
3. Document what learned
4. Commit with clear message
5. Pause-threshold before next piece
```

**Integration session** (Friday):
```
1. Combine week's pieces
2. Test full workflow
3. Document gaps/issues
4. Celebrate what works
5. Plan next week's increment
```

### Monthly Framework Review

**Quarter markers** (regular rhythm):
```
1. Read core principles (still accurate?)
2. Review mission statement (still aligned?)
3. Check vision framework (still true?)
4. Assess collaboration charter (still working?)
5. Update if operational proof suggests changes
```

**Document evolution** (not revolution):
- Small refinements (language clarity)
- New examples (operational proof)
- Pattern recognition (emergence documentation)
- Principle strengthening (confidence from practice)

---

## Emergency Protocols

### When Overwhelmed

**Immediate actions**:
1. **STOP** (full pause_engaged)
2. Close all tools (reduce input)
3. Find environmental tether (cool air, physical anchor)
4. Breathe (literal br[e]ath[e])
5. Don't force recovery (let it come naturally)

**Recovery process**:
1. Return to last stable checkpoint
2. Document what triggered overwhelm
3. Design prevention for next time
4. Resume at slower pace
5. Celebrate resumption (courage recognized)

### When Tools Fail

**Remember**:
- Tools enable, don't replace human capability
- Manual process always available
- Tool failure ≠ framework failure
- Operational proof > automated perfection

**Response**:
1. Fallback to manual process
2. Document what tool couldn't handle
3. Improve tool specification
4. Test with simpler case
5. Rebuild confidence through success

### When Patterns Won't Emerge

**Strategic ignoring isn't working**:
1. Maybe pattern isn't there (that's okay)
2. Maybe needs more time (background burner needs days, not minutes)
3. Maybe needs different perspective (ask different question)
4. Maybe completion isn't required (mystery honored)

**Trust**:
- Not everything resolves
- Undefinable constant exists
- Mystery is feature, not bug
- Operational proof emerges when ready
