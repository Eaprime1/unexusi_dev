# Quick Start Guide

Get up and running with the UNEXUSI development environment in 5 minutes!

## Installation (One Time)

```bash
# 1. Navigate to the repo
cd /home/user/unexusi_dev

# 2. Make setup script executable
chmod +x setup_env.sh

# 3. Run the setup
./setup_env.sh

# 4. Create your .env file
cp .env.example .env

# 5. Edit .env for your location (optional but recommended)
nano .env
```

## Daily Use

### Option 1: Use the Alias (Easiest)

After restarting your terminal:

```bash
unexusi
```

### Option 2: Manual Activation

```bash
source /home/user/unexusi_dev/activate_env.sh
```

## What You Get

When activated, you'll have:

- Python virtual environment with 50+ useful packages
- All development tools (pytest, black, flake8, etc.)
- Environment variables loaded from `.env`
- Working directory set to project root
- Git aliases configured

## Common Tasks

### Run Tests
```bash
pytest
```

### Format Code
```bash
black src/
```

### Lint Code
```bash
flake8 src/
```

### Check Environment
```bash
./scripts/env_info.sh
```

### Deactivate
```bash
deactivate
```

## Drive Mounting

To mount drives automatically on activation:

1. Edit `.env`:
   ```bash
   DRIVE_MOUNT_POINTS=/mnt/data:/dev/sdb1
   ```

2. Re-run setup with sudo:
   ```bash
   sudo ./setup_env.sh
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Alias doesn't work
```bash
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
```

### Virtual environment issues
```bash
rm -rf venv
./setup_env.sh
```

### Need help?
```bash
cat README.md
./scripts/env_info.sh
```

## That's It!

You're ready to develop. Happy coding!
