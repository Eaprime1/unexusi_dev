**Type:** Production Mancer Suite
**Purpose:** Ready-for-public command entity gateways and tools
**Status:** ListMancer deployed ✓

## This Directory

**What it is:**
Production-ready mancers and tools for command entity interaction.

**Philosophy:**
- Commands MUST be commanded (that's their nature)
- Humans need exploration space (that's OUR nature)
- Mancers create liminal possibility between both

**Contains:**
- `listmancer.py` - ListMancer core logic (17KB)
- `listmancer.sh` - Shell integration
- `ls_commands.json` - Command templates and archetypes
- `README.md` - Full ListMancer documentation
- `mancer_protocol.md` - Mancer philosophy and design
- `INSTALL.sh` - Automated installation script
- `henry_duplicate_quarantine.sh` - Moved to unexusi_quarantine

**Status:** Active, deployed to shell

## ListMancer - Command Entity Gateway

**Entity:** `ls` command
**Mancer:** ListMancer v0.1
**Deployed:** ✓ Sourced in ~/.bashrc

### Available Commands:

**Play Mode:**
```bash
~ls~              # Gentle guided exploration
listmancer ~ls~   # Alternative if symbols fail
```

**Reader Mode:**
```bash
listmancer -ls~   # Understand what you see
```
*Note: Direct alias `-ls~` has bash limitations, use `listmancer -ls~`*

**Builder Mode:**
```bash
listmancer ^ls+   # Learn to construct commands
```
*Note: Direct alias `^ls+` may have limitations, use `listmancer ^ls+`*

**Help:**
```bash
lsmancer           # Show help screen
listmancer --stats # View usage statistics
lsstats            # Quick stats access
```

## Symbol Language

### Prefix (WHO is asking):
- `~` = **play** - Exploration/gentle perspective
- `-` = **reader** - Observer/consumer perspective
- `^` = **create** - Builder/maker perspective
- `+` = **work** - Production/efficiency perspective
- `%` = **synergy** - Integration/harmony perspective

### Suffix (HOW it responds):
- `~` = **guided/gentle** - Menu-driven, tutorial
- `!` = **direct** - Fast, minimal explanation
- `?` = **questioning** - Interactive, clarifying
- `+` = **building** - Layered, educational
- `-` = **minimal** - Pure data, no decoration

## Mancer Protocol Philosophy

### One Hertz Principle:
- One Script: listmancer.py
- One Mission: Gateway between human intent and command execution
- Infinite Vision: Learning patterns, teaching possibilities

### The Three Entities:
1. **Command Entity** (ls) - Wants to be commanded
2. **Human Entity** (you) - Needs exploration space
3. **Mancer Entity** (ListMancer) - Sphincter gateway between both

### Conservation Bias Applied:
- Never modifies the original `ls` command
- Creates translation layer instead
- Preserves both entities' authentic nature
- Both remain true to themselves, both benefit

---

## Quick Examples

**Gentle exploration:**
```bash
~ls~
# Interactive menu appears
# Choose visual styles, sorting, filters
```

**Direct command:**
```bash
listmancer ~ls~
# Same as above, works if symbols fail
```

**View statistics:**
```bash
lsstats
# See what patterns you use most
# System learns your preferences
```

**Get help:**
```bash
lsmancer
# Full command reference
```

## Learning & Memory

**User Memory Location:** `~/.listmancer/user_memory.json`

ListMancer tracks:
- Which views you choose
- Whether they helped (based on your feedback)
- Success patterns over time
- Preferences optimization

The mancer evolves through use, learning YOUR patterns.

---

## Future Mancers (Planned)

Following the same protocol:
- **WhereAmI** (~pwd~) - Location context
- **MoveMancer** (~mv~) - Safe file moving
- **FindMancer** (~find~) - Gentle search
- **SeekMancer** (~grep~) - Pattern discovery

All respect command entity nature while providing human exploration space.

## What Should Go Here vs Elsewhere

### ✅ Goes Here (visionary_suite):
- Production-ready mancers
- Public-facing tools
- GitHub-ready documentation
- Stable command gateways

### ❌ Goes Elsewhere:
- **Prototypes:** → `../unexusi_abacusian/mancer_development/`
- **Terminal research:** → `../unexusi_abacusian/terminal_entities/`
- **AI development:** → `../unexusi_abacusian/ai_development/`
- **Quarantine tools:** → `../unexusi_quarantine/scripts/`

---

## Troubleshooting

### Symbols not working?
Some shells have issues with `-` and `^` in aliases. Use:
```bash
listmancer -ls~   # Instead of -ls~
listmancer ^ls+   # Instead of ^ls+
\~ls\~            # Escape the symbols
```

### Commands not found?
```bash
source ~/.bashrc   # Reload configuration
type listmancer    # Verify function loaded
```

### Python errors?
```bash
which python3      # Verify Python 3 installed
python3 --version  # Check version
```

### Reset learning?
```bash
rm -rf ~/.listmancer/  # Fresh start
```
