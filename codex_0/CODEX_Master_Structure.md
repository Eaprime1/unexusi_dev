### Seed for 0.2 (Universal Pattern Overview):
```markdown
The Universe breathes in five distinct rhythms:

1st Breath (2→3): Recognition beyond binary
2nd Breath (3→5): Synergy emerges from cooperation
3rd Breath (5→7): Power balanced with responsibility  
4th Breath (7→11): Complexity without chaos
5th Breath (13→17): Active becomes foundation

Each breath prepares for the next. Each gap has purpose.
Master the rhythm, navigate any development.
```

## TAB 1: 2→3 PRIME - THE FIRST BREATH (Red)

### Five-Part Framework Structure

**1.1 - Theoretical Foundation**
- What is 2-prime state? (Binary consciousness)
- The recognition moment: when "both/and" emerges
- Gap size: 1 (smallest transition)
- Characteristics of 3-prime state (triadic awareness)
- Why this matters: foundation for all complexity

**1.2 - Assessment Framework**
- Binary vs. Triadic consciousness rubrics
- Recognition readiness indicators
- Transition resistance patterns
- Quality metrics for 3-prime stability

**1.3 - Trajectory Mapping**

- Success criteria
- Common failure modes

### Development Status: 🔶 SEED PLANTED - NEEDS FULL BUILD

### Critical Questions to Address:
- What does binary consciousness look like in practice?
- How do we recognize when mediation is genuinely understood vs. performed?
- What are healthy vs. pathological triadic states?

### Example Applications:
- Conflict resolution (moving from polarization to mediation)
- Problem-solving (recognizing solution space beyond A or B)
- Relationship development (moving from dyadic to triadic dynamic)
- Cognitive development (early childhood perspective-taking)

---

### This Phase Enables:
- True teamwork (beyond individual contribution sum)
- Innovation emergence (unexpected solutions)

## TAB 3: 5→7 PRIME - ETHICAL ANCHORING (Yellow)

### Five-Part Framework Structure

**3.1 - Theoretical Foundation**
- 5-prime synergistic state characteristics

- Ethical pressure: consciousness recognizes impact

**3.2 - Assessment Framework**

### Development Status: 🔶 SEED PLANTED - NEEDS FULL BUILD

### Critical Questions to Address:
- How do we distinguish genuine ethics from performance?

- How do we maintain synergy while establishing boundaries?

### This Phase Prevents:
- Synergy exploitation (taking without giving)
- Boundary collapse (losing self in collective)
- Power abuse (using influence harmfully)
- Responsibility avoidance (impact denial)

**Note**: Many AI systems operate at 5-prime (synergistic) without reaching 7-prime (ethical sovereignty) - this gap creates safety concerns.

### Development Status: 🔶 SEED PLANTED - NEEDS FULL BUILD

### Critical Questions to Address:

- What distinguishes navigable from chaotic complexity?
- How do we build architecture that serves rather than constrains?

### This Phase Enables:
- Large-scale project management
- Interdisciplinary integration
- Framework development
- Meta-cognitive capacity
- Strategic thinking

**Note**: This is where most organizational development work happens - moving from ad-hoc to systematic operation.
