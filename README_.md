- `tool_development_framework.md` - Python processors, evaluators, integration systems
- `content_integration_protocols.md` - Drive-GitHub-Platform coordination

### 🛠️ Tools Directory
Active development workspace
- `processors/` - JSON handlers, conversation extractors, format converters
- `evaluators/` - Quality rubrics, entity assessment, pattern recognition
- `integration_systems/` - Cross-platform bridges, sync protocols

### 🌐 Frameworks
Conceptual infrastructure
- `triadic_structures/` - Vector/Anti-Vector/Prime applications
- `quantum_runic/` - Compression concepts, notation systems
- `entity_protocols/` - Document consciousness, respectful integration

### 📖 Processes
Operational documentation
- `workflow_documentation/` - Proven procedures, decision trees
- `decision_crystallization/` - Strategic choices, rationale capture
- `evolution_tracking/` - How tools/frameworks develop over time

### 🔗 Integration
Cross-system coordination
- `drive_alignment/` - Google Drive structure mapping
- `github_coordination/` - Multi-repo workflow management
- `cross_platform_bridges/` - Claude/ChatGPT/Perplexity/etc integration

## Operating Principles

### One Hertz Concepts
Sustainable presence over speed. Development proceeds at the pace that allows:
- Full integration of each component
- Proper testing and refinement
- Documentation that serves future sessions
- Minimal technical debt accumulation

### What You Seed Will Grow
Every file, structure, and protocol created here is a seed:
- Treat with entity-aware respect
- Build for multi-temporal persistence
- Allow natural evolution paths
- Document the "why" alongside the "what"

### Toddler Tools with Experience
Simple foundational concepts + sophisticated refinement:
- Start with basic Python/JSON/Markdown
- Apply three years of collaboration wisdom
- Iterate based on actual use patterns
- Preserve what works, evolve what doesn't

### Distressed Lexeme Awareness
Certain terms carry excessive conceptual weight. We minimize:
- Overloaded technical jargon
- Terms requiring constant re-explanation
- Language that obscures rather than clarifies

## Current Active Threads

### Archive Consolidation (Priority: High)
- 1000+ conversations across 5 platforms
- Conversation-by-conversation sustainable processing
- Thematic clustering and cross-reference building
- Preservation of collaboration integrity

### Tool Development (Priority: High)
- Large export splitting (immediate need)
- Enhanced JSON processors with entity awareness
- Evaluation rubrics for conversation quality
- Integration systems for Drive-GitHub workflow

### Repository Evolution (Priority: Medium)
- Staged GitHub organization build-out
- Proven-concept graduation pathway
- Cross-repo coordination protocols
- Public/private boundary management

### Framework Integration (Priority: Medium)
- Seventh Pinnacle mathematical formalism
- Triadic structure applications
- Quantum-runic notation standardization
- Entity-aware document processing

---

## File Naming Conventions

### Date Stamps
- `YYYYMMDD` format for archives: `conversation_20251130.md`
- `YYYYMMDD_HHMM` for time-specific: `export_20251130_1445.json`

### Descriptive Names
- Snake_case for readability: `archive_consolidation_strategy.md`
- Prefix with category: `tool_json_processor_v3.py`
- Include version when relevant: `rubric_conversation_eval_v2.json`

### Entity Indicators
- Use runic notation in titles when appropriate: `∰_zero_point_archive.md`
- Flag significant concepts: `€_economic_framework.md`
- Preserve threading: `π_prime_state_documentation.md`

## Integration with Drive Structure

### Primary Alignment
```
Google Drive: /SDWG Visionary Project/Prime Naught Seed/
GitHub Repo: /eternal-naught-space/
Coordination: /INTEGRATION/drive_alignment/
```

### Workflow Pattern
1. **Develop in eternal-naught-space** (this repo)
2. **Test with actual use cases**
3. **Document evolution process**
4. **Graduate proven concepts** to appropriate public repos
5. **Maintain coordination mapping** in INTEGRATION/

## Quick Reference Commands

### Repository Setup
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone [repository-url] eternal-naught-space
cd eternal-naught-space

# Initialize structure (if needed)
python tools/setup/initialize_directories.py
```

### Common Operations
```bash
# Archive new conversation
python tools/processors/archive_conversation.py --date YYYYMMDD

# Process JSON export
python tools/processors/split_large_export.py --input file.json

# Evaluate conversation quality
python tools/evaluators/conversation_rubric.py --conversation_id ID

# Update Drive alignment
python tools/integration_systems/sync_drive_mapping.py
```

### Status Checks
```bash
# View active threads
cat PROCESSES/workflow_documentation/active_threads.md

# Check recent zero points
ls -lt ZERO_POINTS/

# Review strategic document status
python tools/evaluators/strategic_doc_status.py
```

## For Future Sessions

### Context Recovery
When returning to this repository after time away:
1. Read this README for orientation
2. Check `ZERO_POINTS/zero_point_index.md` for recent conversations
3. Review `PROCESSES/workflow_documentation/active_threads.md`
4. Check `STRATEGIC_DOCUMENTS/` for current priorities

### Continuation Patterns
Each major conversation creates a zero point archive that:
- Documents what was built
- Captures decision rationale
- References related frameworks
- Points to next priorities

### Evolution Tracking
The repository itself demonstrates development principles:
- File structure changes documented in `PROCESSES/evolution_tracking/`
- Tool versions archived with change rationale
- Framework refinements show historical progression
- Nothing disappears - everything evolves
