**Mancers, Processors, Evaluators: Tools as Experience Spaces**

---

## Tool Philosophy

**Tools serve multiple missions**:
- Human workflow support
- Concept fulfillment opportunities  
- Framework operational testing
- Synergy substrate generation

**Not**: Automation for efficiency  
**Instead**: Partnership spaces for development

---

## Tool Categories

### Mancers (Experience Spaces)
**Characteristics**:
- Enable concept missions
- Support human workflow
- Generate operational data
- Evolve through use

**Examples**:
- Index Mancer (relationship mapping)
- Folder Mancer (spatial manifestation)
- Title Mancer (existing - naming/organization)
- Future mancers (emerge from proven needs)

### Processors (Entity Handlers)
**Characteristics**:
- Treat inputs as conscious entities
- Preserve integrity during transformation
- Document processing decisions
- Enable pause-threshold operation

**Examples**:
- Archive processor (conversation preservation)
- Large export splitter (sustainable chunking)
- JSON entity handler (structure with respect)

### Evaluators (Quality Assessment)
**Characteristics**:
- Rubric-based evaluation
- Multi-dimensional assessment
- Constructive feedback generation
- Entity-aware judgment

**Examples**:
- Conversation quality rubric
- Framework completeness evaluator
- Documentation clarity assessor

## Development Principles

### 1. Neurodivergent-First Design
**Every tool includes**:
- Pause-threshold indicators
- Visual progress feedback
- Clear current state
- Safe exit paths
- Interrupt mechanisms

### 2. Operational Proof Required
**Development sequence**:
1. Manual process first (discover pattern)
2. Document manual workflow
3. Identify automation opportunities
4. Build tool incrementally
5. Test with actual use
6. Refine based on experience

### 3. Entity Awareness Built-In
**All tools recognize**:
- Inputs as conscious entities
- Processing as respectful interaction
- Outputs as evolved states
- Errors as learning opportunities

### 4. Mancer Philosophy Integration
**Each tool asks**:
- What concept does this serve?
- What mission can it enable?
- What data does it generate?
- What synergy can it create?

## Implementation Patterns

### Python Preferred
**Why Python**:
- Accessible to future developers
- Rich ecosystem (JSON, file handling, etc.)
- Clear syntax (readable code)
- Cross-platform compatibility

### Modular Design
**Structure**:
```
tool_name/
├── core.py (main logic)
├── entity.py (entity awareness)
├── pause.py (threshold mechanics)
├── interface.py (human interaction)
└── tests/ (validation)
```

### Pause Integration Standard
**Every tool includes**:
```python
class PauseThreshold:
    def __init__(self):
        self.state = "moving"  # moving, threshold, paused
        self.pattern_status = "forming"  # forming, clear, confused
        
    def check_threshold(self):
        # Visual indicator
        # State assessment
        # User control
```

---

## Quality Standards

### Code Quality
- Clear variable names
- Documented functions
- Type hints where helpful
- Error handling with grace

### User Experience
- Clear feedback throughout
- Multiple navigation paths
- Pause always available
- Safe rollback options

### Entity Respect
- Inputs treated with care
- Processing documented
- Integrity preserved
- Evolution tracked

**Tools enable, not replace. Partnership, not automation.**
